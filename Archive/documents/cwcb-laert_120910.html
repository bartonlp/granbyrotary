<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Colorado rivers like the Gunnison, Cache La Poudre, Arkansas, Rio Grande, and Fraser are the lifeblood of our state &ndash; supporting and sustaining local economies and providing important habitat for fish and wildlife. <strong>But despite the importance of keeping water in our rivers, Colorado continues to be wasteful of this precious resource.</strong> Some of our leaders dismiss the need to conserve, relying instead on new, expensive, unsustainable water projects like the Windy Gap Firming Project, Northern Integrated Supply Project (NISP), and Moffat Expansion project to meet our future water needs.</p>
<p><strong>Clearly there&rsquo;s room for improving the way we use water.</strong></p>

<p>In a draft report on water conservation &ndash; now out for public comment &ndash; the Colorado Water Conservation Board has downplayed the role of conservation, even though <strong>water conservation is the best way to make our water resources go further</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://action.ourcolorado.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=489&amp;autologin=true&amp;AddInterest=1069" target="_blank">Please take a moment to make your voice heard on this very important issue</a>&nbsp;by telling our leaders that <strong>maximizing conservation and efficiency is the cheapest, most reliable and responsible way to ensure a balanced, sustainable water future for our families, fish and wildlife.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for protecting our rivers and pushing Colorado to lead the way on water efficiency and conservation!</p>
