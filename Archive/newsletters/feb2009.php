<h2>Plan for Granby Rotary Club Social Feb. 20 at Maverick's</h2>

<p>Very-silent-auction items sought. The Granby Rotary Club is hosting
a club social event Friday night, Feb. 20 at Maverick's in Granby.
Maverick's is owned and operated by our own Rotary Club member Sean
Richardson.</p>

<p>Cocktails and appetizers start at 6:30 p.m. in the lounge followed
by dinner in the large dining room at 7:30. Beverages include cash
bar, water, iced tea and coffee.  Appetizers include bacon-wrapped
shrimp, mini-quiche and a vegetable platter.  Dinner includes prime
rib carving station and crusted sea bass with salad, dinner rolls,
mashed potatoes and gravy and a vegetable medley.  Dessert includes
chocolate fudge cake or caramel flan. Cost is $30 per person, which
includes tax and tip.  The cut-off for reservations is Feb. 11.</p>

<p>Also, Club President Tim Schowalter wants to remind club members
that we will also be conducting a silent, silent auction in an attempt
to raise funds for the club. So, if you have a service or item to
donate, or know of people who do, bidding will take place Friday
night, Feb.  20 at Maverick's.</p>

<h2>Club business meeting on tap for Feb. 11</h2>

meeting. Be prepared to discuss and learn about upcoming club events
and initiatives.</p>

<h2>DollyWood project continues to gain in popularity</h2>

<p>Offering continued positive exposure for our Club, the DollyWood
Imagination Library preschool reading project continues to see
excellent growth in our region, says Granby Rotarian Jack Bakken.
More and more preschool-aged children have signed up! That exceeds our
expectations.</p>

<p>This project, sponsored by the Rotary Club of Granby, Grand
Beginnings and the Grand County Library District, makes free books
available to preschool-aged children. They must commit to read the
books or have the books read to them by a parent or guardian.  The
inclusion of the zip codes in Hot Sulphur Springs and Tabernash for
our coverage area in the program seems to have helped the popularity
of the program.</p>

<h2>Call-in cut-off for Rotary Lunch changed</h2>

<p>Jeff Shaw has managed to work out a more convenient call-in time
for Granby Rotary lunch cut-offs. It's been changed to 9 a.m.
Wednesday. So, Rotarians who are likely to miss the week's luncheon
can still call Jeff Shaw's office at 887-3131 to cancel, but now we
have a little more time than in the recent past. Thanks Jeff!</p>

<h2>Rotary looking for host family candidates</h2>

<p>Rotary Clubs across Grand County are hoping to find families
willing to host exchange students next year. Contact Club President
Tim Schowalter for more information.</p>
