<h3>Put May 12 Earth Day Work Events On Your Calendar!</h3>

<p>Rhonda Farrell continues to work on the Earth Day clean-up day in
Granby. Even though we didn't get a $1,000 Rotary Foundation grant we
had hoped for, plans are moving forward to clean up parts of Granby
and plant some trees.</p>

<h3>Dollywood Project Continues To Gain In Popularity</h3>

<p>Offering continued positive exposure for our Club The DollyWood
Imagination Library preschool reading project continues to see
excellent growth in our region, says Granby Rotarian Jack Bakken.
More and more preschool-aged children have signed up! That exceeds our
expectations.  This project, sponsored by the Rotary Club of Granby,
Grand Beginnings and the Grand County Library District, makes free
books available to preschool-aged children. They must commit to read
the books or have the books read to them by a parent or guardian.  The
inclusion of the zip codes in Hot Sulphur Springs and Tabernash for
our coverage area in the program seems to have helped the popularity
of the program.</p>

<h3>Call-In Cut-Off For Rotary Lunch Changed</h3>

<p>Jeff Shaw has managed to work out a more convenient call-in time
for Granby Rotary lunch cut-offs.</p>

<p>It's been changed to 9 a.m. Wednesday. So, Rotarians who are likely
to miss the week's luncheon can still call Jeff Shaw's office at
887-3131 to cancel, but now we have a little more time than in the
recent past.</p>

<p>Thanks Jeff!</p>
