<h2>President's Message Emphasized Positive</h2>

<p>During the last business meeting he will preside over as president
of the Club, Tim Schowalter had good news about our successes tempered
with a reality check.  The reality check was this: Our club is
granting out more money than it brings in through fundraisers. That's
good as it means we are making a mark in our community. It's bad
because it's hurting our fund balance. He urged a continued effort to
find more ways to raise funds or we might have to cut programs. He
said that will be a priority decision for our new, incoming president,
Jan Knisley.  Schowalter also highlighted how we still need to get new
members into the Granby Club. He said the club has many new members,
but that has been offset by the losses of longstanding members for a
variety of reasons.  Tim Schowalter has presided over the Rotary Club
of Granby in challenging yet fulfilling times. He has exemplified the
core values of Rotary International while keeping our Club local and
important.  Thanks, Tim, for your hard work.  Jan Knisley has a strong
example to follow.</p>

<h2>Special Award Presentations Last Week</h2>

<p>Thanks go out to Rhonda Farrell for her fun and inspiring talk last
week (June 10) during which she expounded on the values of Rotary
while also recognizing Rotarians in our Club. Attendance, service and
organization were all honored during her excellent presentation.
Plaques were also handed out to those honored.  Thanks, Rhonda!
Please forgive the closed eyes in the photos &hellip; although Bill
Edelstein's photo turned out well.</p>

<h2>Two Fund-Raising Events On Tap</h2>

<p>Firefighters convention and the popular July 4th barbecue in the
park. Volunteers are needed for both!  First, the Granby Firefighters
Convention, set for June 19, will allow Rotarians to share in proceeds
from selling food at the events. Contact

<a href="/email.php?id=17xx&subject=Firefighters+volunteer">Mark
   Krieg</a>

for more information (887-9307) or go the the Granby Rotary Club
web-site (www.granbyrotary.org) to put your name on a sign-up list.
Then the very important fundraiser at the Granby July Fourth
celebration will take place. This is a big money maker for the Club
and many volunteers are needed to help serve the hungry hordes at the
picnic lunch following the parade.

This year <a href="/email.php?id=36&subject=Fourth+Volunteer">Bill
   Edelstein</a> and <a
   href="/email.php?id=5&subject=Fourth+Volunteer">Tom Chaffin</a>

are taking on the job of getting this event organized. Sign the
volunteer sheet that will be passed out at meetings or contact Bill or
Tom to let them know what you want to do.  Watch for a sign-up sheet
on the web page as well.</p>

<h2>Make Plans Now To Participate In the 2nd Annual WPFV
   Rotary Golf Tournament.</h2>

<p>The Shotgun start will be at 1:00 p.m. on Monday July 27th.  Once
again this year proceeds from the Tourney will go to support Rotary
International's fight to completely eradicate Polio from the Earth.
Are you a local business person?  Know one?  Winter Park/Fraser Rotary
is looking for hole sponsors to help support our tournament for a
sponsorship of $100.  Contact President Mark Lund at Grand Mountain
Bank (887-1221) to sign up to play or be a hole sponsor.  Cost to play
will be $125 a player.</p>

<h2>Club Matches Donations</h2>

<p>The Granby Rotary Club Board of Directors decided to offer up to
$500 in club funds to meet the needs of the food bank and Granby
preschool. The board decided June 1 to match up to $250 for each of
two entities &mdash; the <b>Mountain Food Bank</b> and the new
<b>Granby Playdays Preschool</b>. As many know, the demands being put
on food banks has picked up recently. Our club has even conduced
canned food drives to help out. But now the board has decided to take
a different approach and offer $500 in cash to the food bank if club
members come up with $250. Our club will match each gift up to $250.
The board is taking the same approach with responding to a request for
funds to help with the start-up of a new preschool in Granby, called
<b>Granby Playdays Preschool</b>. The town of Granby has donated a
building for the preschool, but remodeling costs (for materials), are
needed.  The new preschool is being formed because the <b>C Lazy U
Preschool</b> closed this spring and the Mountain Family Center's
preschool in Grand Lake also closed.</p>

<h2>Dollywood Foundation Book Donation Program &mdash; 90 Children!</h2>

<p>A success, for sure &hellip; The Granby Rotary Club has helped to
finance in a big way the very successful Dollywood Foundation
book-giveaway program that promotes reading in preschool-aged
children.  Club member and project organizer Jack Bakken reports that
more than 90 children are now receiving books through the program,
which is a large number for our small market area.  Rotarians should
be proud of our success in this effort.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Host Families Being Sought</h2>

<p>The Winter Park/Fraser Rotary Club will be hosting a girl from
Argentina this next school year as part of the Rotary Exchange
program. The Club is seeking host families.  

Hosting a student is possibly one of the most interesting and
rewarding experiences you and your family can have with far less
effort than you might think.</p>
