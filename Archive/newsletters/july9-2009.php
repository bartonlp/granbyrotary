<h2>District Governor Mike Oldham Addresses Granby Rotary Club</h2>

<p>The new 2009/2010 District 5054 Governor Mike Oldham addressed our
   club at our regular July 8 noon business meeting. Mike emphasized
   Rotary's commitment to the &quot;End Polio Now&quot; program. The
   goal for this year is to raise $100,000,000 by October 24
   &quot;Polio Day&quot;. This years thrust is to get the community
   involved in giving. The district is working on a new web site to
   collect donations from the public. The web page is
   http://www.endpolio.org, it will be updated during the next month
   for the new year's campaign.</p>
<p>Mike met with the Granby Rotary Club board of directors prior to
   the meeting and discussed our plans for the new year and fund
   raising (see presidents message below). Mike pledged the districts
   and his own support to help us grow our membership and develop
   better fund raising events.</p>

<h2>Fourth of July Picnic Fund Raiser Great Success</h2>

<p>The Granby Rotary Club's annual fourth of July picnic fund raiser
was a big success with over 600 meals sold. The club made $2,420 net
on the event. The annual Granby parade and picnic is our biggest fund
raiser and this year it was a great success thank to chairs Thomas
Chaffin and Bill Edelstein who did a tremendous job organizing the
event. Thanks also goes to the many volunteers that made the event
possible. This year hamburgers, or hot-dogs plus chips and a drink
were sold for $6 or $20 for a family of four. The weather cooperated
and we all had a beautiful day of parade, food and fun.</p>

<h2>President Jan Knisley's Message</h2>

<p>As we start this new year in Rotary our club faces a budget short fall of
   about $1,000. Over the past couple of years our club's funds have been
   running lower. We need to develop new exciting fund raisers. One
   area we have neglected in the past is our winter season. During
   winter Grand County attracts a lot of winter sports enthusiasts and
   we need to have events that focus on these folks. Over the next
   couple of months the board with the help of all members will try to
   create new fund raising events that will tap into the winter sports
   fans. Any thoughts that members my have should be brought to the
   attention of the board. Contact board members at the weekly
   meetings or use the <b>Members</b> page on the web site to mail you
   ideas. The last thing we want to do is curtail our charitable
   activities due to a lack of funds.</p>

<h2>Next Blood Drive July 20</h2>

<p>"Service Above Self" is the Rotarian motto and giving blood is one way
to live up to that motto. The local blood bank always needs reserves
and the Rotary sponsored blood drive is a great service to the Grand
County community.

family or learning more about what is required, contact our Youth
Committee Chair, Judith Graham at 726-9543</p>

<h2>Winter Park/Fraser Club Program &quot;Club Visioning&quot;</h2>
