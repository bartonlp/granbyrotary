<h3>Ecuador Update is on Tap for Program of Wednesday, March 4</h3>

<p>The program for this Wednesday's luncheon meeting at the Inn at
SilverCreek should be interesting. Eden Recor and Pam Gilbert will be
on hand to inform our club about the latest developments with the
Ecuadorian highland village improvements.</p>

<p>Eden Recor has been to the village to help on a water project and his
information, along with Pam's, should be interesting.</p>

<p>The Granby Rotary Club has heard about these efforts before and has
donated funds to the efforts to bring water, a school house and other
improvements to this isolated yet beautiful village high in the
Andes.</p>

<p>Winter social dinner was a big success at Maverick's The Granby
Rotary Club Winter Social was a big success. Excellent food by
Maverick's (our own Rotary Club member Sean Richardson is the owner,
operator) helped make a night of great socializing worthwhile.  We
filled the guest rooms to overflowing and managed to raise more than
$1,000 in the informal silent auction!</p>

<h3>Put May 12 Earth Day Work Events on Your Calendar!</h3> <p>Rhonda
Farrell continues to work on the Earth Day clean-up day in Granby.
Even though we didn't get a $1,000 Rotary Foundation grant we had
hoped for, plans are moving forward to clean up parts of Granby and
plant some trees.</p>

<hr/>
<h3>Dollywood Project Continues to Gain in Popularity</h3>

<p>The project offers continued positive exposure for our Club.  The
DollyWood Imagination Library preschool reading project continues to
see excellent growth in our region, says Granby Rotarian Jack Bakken.
More and more preschool-aged children have signed up! That exceeds our
expectations.</p>

<p>This project, sponsored by the Rotary Club of Granby,
Grand Beginnings and the Grand County Library District, makes free
books available to preschool-aged children. They must commit to read
the books or have the books read to them by a parent or guardian.  The
inclusion of the zip codes in Hot Sulphur Springs and Tabernash for
our coverage area in the program seems to have helped the popularity
of the program.</p>

<h3>New Member Barton Phillips Unveils Web-Site</h3>

Phillips has put in on the new club web-site. Club members can post
announcements and find out about other Club Happenings on the site. Be

<h3>Call-In Cut-Off for Rotary Lunch Changed</h3>

<p>Jeff Shaw has managed to work out a more convenient call-in time
for Granby Rotary lunch cut-offs.</p>

<p>It's been changed to 9 a.m. Wednesday. So, Rotarians who are likely
to miss the week's luncheon can still call Jeff Shaw's office at
887-3131 to cancel, but now we have a little more time than in the
recent past.</p>

<p>Thanks Jeff!</p>
