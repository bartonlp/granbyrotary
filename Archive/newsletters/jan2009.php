<h3>Granby Rotary Club Social Feb. 20</h3>

mini-quiche and a vegetable platter.  Dinner includes prime rib

fudge cake or caramel flan. Cost is $30 per person, which includes tax

</p>
<h3><i>Very-silent-auction</i>
items sought. </h3>
<p>
Also, Club President Tim Schowalter wants to remind club members
that we will also be conducting a silent auction in an attempt
to raise funds for the club; so, if you have a service or item to
donate, or know of people who do, bidding will take place Friday
night, Feb. 20 at Maverick's.</p>

<h3>DollyWood Project</h3>
<p>
DollyWood project continues to gain in popularity, offering continued
positive exposure for our Club. The DollyWood Imagination Library
preschool reading project continues to see excellent growth in our
region, says Granby Rotarian Jack Bakken. As of Jan. 21 a total of 53
preschool-aged children had signed up! That exceeds our expectations.
This project, sponsored by the Rotary Club of Granby, Grand Beginnings
and the Grand County Library District, makes free books available to
preschool-aged children. They must commit to read the books or have
the books read to them by a parent or guardian.  The inclusion of the
zip codes in Hot Sulphur Springs and Tabernash for our coverage area
in the program seems to have helped the popularity of the program.

<h3>Welcome to new member Barton Phillips</h3>

<p>
Granby Rotarians learned some interesting facts about the life of
Barton Phillips, the newest member to our Club.
</p><p>
Barton has stepped in with lots of energy and enthusiasm. He has taken
over the task of assigning weekly programs and has agreed to get the
club's web-site up and running. He's hoping to get a domain name of
<b>granbyrotary.org</b>. 
</p><p>
He's also agreed to be our Club's President-Elect designee.
</p><p>
He moved to Grand Couny in January, 2007 after a career as a
consulting computer engineer, four years in the air force and in
various film projects. He's travelled extensively but is now happy to
be living in Granby Ranch.
</p><p>
Welcome to the Club Barton!

<h3>Health Fair meeting set for Feb. 12 </h3>
<p>
A planning meeting for the <b>9Health Fair</b>, which the Granby Rotary Club
sponsors, is set for Feb. 12 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Grand
County EMS Building in Granby. Those planning to play a major role in
this important club event should plan to attend.

<h3>Call-in cut-off for Rotary Lunch changed</h3>
<p>
Jeff Shaw has managed to work out a more convenient call-in time for
Granby Rotary lunch cut-offs.
</p><p>
It's been changed to 9 a.m. Wednesday. So, Rotarians who are likely to
miss the week's luncheon can still call Jeff Shaw's office at 887-3131
to cancel, but now we have a little more time than in the recent past.
</p><p>
Thanks Jeff!
