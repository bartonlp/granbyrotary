   // common to all sites in the '/home/bartonlp/includes' directory which also has the
   // 'database-engines' directory.
   // SITE_INCLUDES is under the SITE_ROOT which is where we found the '.sitemap.php' file during
   // our search in siteautoload.php. On lamphost.net this would be something like

   // send emails when errors occur.
   // After the email defines we have two arrays, one for the database information ($dbinfo),
   // and one for the site information ($siteinfo). These are used by the Database class and the
