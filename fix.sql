This program provides a book a month\r\nto participating families. The children\'s books are sent directly to the child each month, the only requirement is a commitment\r\nfrom the parents to read the books to their children. Granby Rotary started this program two years ago and it has become an\r\noverwhelming success. Currently the Granby Club has 93 pre-schoolers participating, with about another 80 between Grand Lake, Winter\r\nPark, and Kremmling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Community Service Grants</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Little League</li>\r\n  <li>Middle Park High School After-Prom Party</li>\r\n  <li>Adopt-a-Hightway (five miles on US-40 & US-34)</li>\r\n  <li>Granby Library Summer Reading Program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Granby Skate Park</h3>\r\n<p>The Club joined in partnership\r\nwith the Town of Granby to develop the Granby Skate Park, a facility\r\nfor local youth and adults who enjoy skateboarding and rollerblading\r\nactivities. Members were involved in the planning and installation\r\nof park improvements, and in fund raising activities to pay the\r\ncosts of such improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Adopt-A-Highway</h3>\r\n<p>We have adopted approximately five miles of US-40 and US-34 around Granby. The club has a \"clean-up\" program and members\r\npick-up trash along these highways to help keep Grand County beautiful.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fourth of July Barbeque</h3>\r\n<p>The Club also serves a lunch in the Town\r\nPark following the Granby 4th of July parade. This is one of our major fund raisers and a great chance for Rotarian Fellowship.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Progressive Dinner</h3>\r\n<p>The Club hosts fellowship parties during the year. In 2010 we sponsored the first <b>Progressive Dinner</b> which\r\nspotlighted the best Granby eateries. This dinner will be a regular winter event.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Earth Day</h3>\r\n<p>We started our Earth Day project in 2009 to cleanup the town and plant trees at the Middle school. With the help of the student we pickup trash in and around the town of Granby. After the cleanup the students plant trees at the Middle school. The trees and supervision are provided by the Granby Rotary Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The 9HealthFair</h3>\r\n<p>One of our major community events is the 9HeatlthFair help in April. Club volunteers help to make this a major community health event. The club in conjunction with 9 News and many other organizations sponsor a day when local residents can get blood tests and other important health screenings done at a very reasonable price.</p>\r\n','2011-02-25 16:00:55','active','2011-02-26 00:00:55','25'),(134,'about.php','YouthPrograms','Youth Programs','<ul>\r\n   <li>The Club sponsors the Boy Scout troop and Cub Scout Pack</li>\r\n   <li>The Club sponsors two to four annual scholarship\r\n      awards to Middle Park High School students.\r\n      In 2009 the Club provided four $1,000 scholarships to graduating seniors.\r\n      In 2010, the Club provided two $1,000 scholarships to graduating seniors at Middle Park High School.</li>\r\n   <li>The Club also sends one or two qualified student from Middle Park High School to the District \r\n      <a href=\'http://rmryla.org/\'>Rotary Youth Leadership\r\n      Award</a> (RYLA) conference each year.

We are drawing our super successful Rotary Year to a close.\r\nThe District Conference was a great success with 468 registrants and 64 of the 67 clubs represented. Thank you all for your participation. Please look at the District Newsletter that will be coming out next week for photos and highlights of the event.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The District Business meeting was the most attended business meeting in years. Thanks to all of you for sending informed and interested delegates. Here is the result of the vote(s):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Council on Legislation (COL)Representative- PDG Mike Oldham, Alternate-PDG Mat Matson\r\n<li>Proposed Legislation  for COL –\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Parker Memorandum of Understanding RI and Peace Corps YES\r\n<li>Denver Mile High change of wording 4-Way Test NO\r\n<li>Acceptance of the proposed 2011/12 District 5450 Budget with increase levy YES\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Fiesta de la Danza-30 traditional Mexican Folk Dancers from Manzanillo, Mexico will be performing at the Embassy Suites, Centennial, Saturday evening, May 7 at 6 p.m.  This event will be sponsored by both the Centennial Rotary Club and Embassy Suites.  Light snacks and beverages will be available and there is a cash bar.  This is a perfect opportunity for fellow Rotarians, their families and Interact Clubs to see how students can rebound from unfortunate circumstances, as these dancers are from The Children\'s Foundation, an orphanage in Manzanillo.  A sombrero will be passed to help defer costs and monies will go to the Centennial Rotary Foundation and The Children\'s Foundation. Any questions,  call Centennial President, Randy Pote at 720-281-2370.</p>\r\n<p>The Presidential Citations are in and your AG will be delivering and presenting them to you if you qualified. The Citations with Distinction are a really cool patch that you can sew onto your banner. I had a goal of every club receiving the citation, and we came close to making that goal. Thanks to all of you.</p>\r\n<p>Please plan on attending the District Assembly on June 4, 2011.
